Abstract Classes on Sololearn

You are given a Vehicle base class, and two subclasses, Car and Bicycle.

Both classes have a drive() method which is called in main, using Vehicle pointers.

Complete the Vehicle class, so that it correctly represents a Vehicle abstraction.

* Remember, an abstract class should include a pure virtual function, which the derived classes must implement. 

A pure virtual function or pure virtual method is a virtual function that is required to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract. Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed "abstract" and they cannot be instantiated directly.
